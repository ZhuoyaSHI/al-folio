<!-- Experienced Data Scientist and Civil Engineer specializing in data analysis, modeling techniques, and digital transformation in the construction and civil engineering sectors. Proven ability to develop innovative solutions for data collection and visualization, with extensive experience in project management and collaboration with industry partners.

During my time at NYU, I published eight papers in prestigious academic journals and conferences, including *Automation in Construction*, *Journal of Construction Engineering and Management*, and *Journal of Building Engineering*. My passion to support emerging young engineers led me to mentor undergraduate and high school students, in addition to two years of teaching experience I gained as a graduate teaching assistant. -->

<!-- As a data scientist and researcher, I work at the intersection of urban infrastructure, advanced technology, and public safety. My research is centered on leveraging the power of AI, machine learning, and data analytics to enhance the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of urban environments. I am passionate about bridging the gap between academia and industry by applying research-driven strategies to real-world challenges, creating innovative solutions that not only improve the built environment but also elevate the quality of life for those living in our cities. Through my work, I strive to develop technologies and insights that support safer, smarter, and more resilient urban spaces. -->
Focused on the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) with Building Information Modeling
(BIM), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Geo-spatial Analysis to enhance urban infrastructure safety, efficiency, and
sustainability. Key interests include data-driven urban fa√ßade inspection, geospatial data analytics, and the application of NLP
for civil engineering challenges. Dedicated to advancing smart city innovations and sustainable urban development through
interdisciplinary research.
